# Alpha Roadmap

## Payments/Compliance
- [ ] Subscriptions
	- [ ] Integrate with Stripe Checkout and Stripe Billing
	- [ ] Stripe Billing/Checkout Docs: https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted
		- [ ] We need a Monthly and a Yearly Subscription
	- [ ] We should have a Web Hook where any time a user space, location, category, or general suggestion is accepted, we give them a month off for free using Stripe. 
- [ ] Transparency Trackers
	- [ ] Donation Tracker: 2-4k in Donations publicly available based on donating the 10% of all Profit. 
	- [ ] Profit Transparency: Visualize how every subscription is monetized: 
		- **Expenses for every 5 dollars**
			- 45c to Stripe
			- 50c saved to donate to non profit
			- [ ] Determine Other Sources here
			- [ ] This means 80% goes to paying for expenses to maintain the site and to support the team. 
		- **General Expenses**
			- **Backend**: $20 a month to Supabase for their BaaS 
			- **Hosting**: 
				- $20 a month to Vercel for their Pro Plan
				- $6 a month to Digital Ocean for their VPS to perform automatic actions. 
	- [ ] Open Source:
		- [ ] We Aim to Open Source isolated aspects of our Technical Architecture when it's safe to do so; in other words it needs to be reviewed to make sure no flaws that could harm our users are exposed. 
		- [ ] Potential things to Open Source
			- [ ] The UI and ways we calculate the four different safety scores
			- [ ] Custom Tip Tap Editor Instance
			- [ ] Donation Tracker source code
